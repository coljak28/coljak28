- Hi, I’m Jakob Collins.
- This page is for my LIS 590 DFW.
- For my project I will work to update the Kelso Public Library's adult non-fiction collection to weed old, outdated, and offensive materials.
- Later, I will be recommending materials for ordering to fill subject gaps and to create a more accurate representation of Kelso's diverse community.
- You can reach me at: coljak28@uw.edu
